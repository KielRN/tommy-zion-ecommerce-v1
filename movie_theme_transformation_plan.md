# Movie-Themed E-commerce Website Transformation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines how to transform the Tommy Zion e-commerce website to have a cinematic, movie-themed aesthetic while maintaining its core product selling functionality. The goal is to create an immersive shopping experience with movie-inspired visuals and styling.

## 1. Color Scheme Enhancement

### Current Color Palette
The website already has the following color palette in the `tommyzion` namespace:
- Blacks: #000000, #1A1A1A, #2D2D2D
- Reds: #8B0000, #A50000, #FF0000, #FF4444
- Metallics: Silver (#C0C0C0), Gold (#B8860B), Slate (#708090)

### Proposed Cinematic Color Enhancements
We'll expand this palette to create a more cinematic feel:

```typescript
cinematic: {
  // Dark theater-inspired colors
  theater: {
    dark: "#121212",      // Dark theater walls
    seats: "#2C1A1A",     // Dark red theater seats
    curtain: "#571D1D",   // Theater curtain red
  },
  // Film-inspired colors
  film: {
    strip: "#333333",     // Film strip color
    frame: "#DDD6C9",     // Vintage film frame
    silver: "#E5E5E5",    // Silver screen
  },
  // Spotlight/Premiere colors
  spotlight: {
    gold: "#FFD700",      // Award/Oscar gold
    red: "#CC0000",       // Red carpet
    flash: "#FFFAFA",     // Camera flash
